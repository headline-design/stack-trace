# Stack Trace

## Overview
TEAL (Transaction Execution Approval Language) is an assembly-like stack language used to write apps for the Algorand blockchain. Stack Trace is a simple tool to aid in debugging TEAL by parsing TEAL opcodes, visualizing the stack and storage after the execution of each opcode and logging the global/local states on completion of the TEAL program. The initial focus of Stack Trace is to support basic mathematical and storage functions, which can be particularly challenging to mentally track during the authoring of TEAL code.

## Progress report: 
Stack Trace currently supports the following opcodes:

-  `int`
-  `byte`
-  `store`
-  `load`
-  `app_local_get`
-  `app_global_get`
-  `app_local_put`
-  `app_global_put`
-  `+`
-  `-`
-  `*`
-  `/`
-  `!=`
-  `!`
-  `==`
-  `||`
-  `&&`
-  `>`
-  `>=`
-  `<`
-  `<=`
-  `global`
-  `b`
-  `bnz`
-  `bz`
-  `return`
-  `pop`
-  `txn`
-  `swap`

## Extending:
To add more opcodes, simply add the opcode as a new key to the opCodes object in `opcodes.js`. A complete list and description of TEAL opcodes is available at:

https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/avm/teal/opcodes/

The format of a Stack Trace opcode value should look like:

```jsx

app_global_put: {
        pushes: {
            number: 0,
            type: "any"
        },
        pops: {
            number: 2,
            type: "any"
        },
        op: function(progData,args){
            progData.app_global[args[0]] = args[1]
        },
        inline: false
    }
```

### Opcode object keys:

-  `pushes.number`: number of values (if any) that will be added to the stack
-  `pops.number`: number of values (if any) that will be removed from the stack and used as arguments for the op function
-  `op`: function that will be executed by the opcode (all op functions must take in the args of `progData` and `args`
-  `inline`: boolean value that indicates whether the opcode takes arguments from the stack or inline

## Usage:
Stack Trace is very simple to use, as it currently has no dependencies. After cloning the repository, simply paste the TEAL code to evaluate into the teal var in main.js. To add dummy transactions and/or app global/local state values, simply modify the `txns`, `app_global`, and/or `accounts` variables in `main.js`. In the terminal, enter:

```bash
node main.js
```

The terminal will log the supported opcodes, then proceed to evaluate each opcode and log data in the following format:

```bash
OpCode:
+
Pops:
2
Type:
uint64
[ 125, 150 ]
Stack after opcode +:
[ 275 ]
```

Finally, on completion of the TEAL program, the tracer will log the current local/global states:

```bash
App Global State:
{ depositAmount: 200, staked: 90 }
App Local State:
{ amt: 150 }
```
